A Christmas gamemode for ZDaemon, it's not been tested with other ports and it probably won't work with them either (yet).

# Gamemode description
Two teams are created at random. A team of reindeer and a team of hunters. 
The hunters go after the reindeer with their net and have to get as close as possible to the reindeer to be able catch them.
The reindeer are faster and can move through the map more easily because their hitbox is smaller.
Once a reindeer is captured, it still has a chance to escape by jumping and breaking the box or being freed by another player. 
The task is therefore up to the hunters to keep the deer in their box. They can do this, for example, by standing on it.

At least 3 players are needed for this gamemode to work, you'll also need to run it in Survival mode.
It pretty much runs with every FFA .wad, as long as there's outside area's and enough spots to hide as a reindeer.
Thanks for checking out this mode!
